The site I made would be my reference on what the actual site would look like when I do it from scratch. It's about our family business website that would hopefully be available soon after our opening within the month.

The Home page would be for all the updates and other things about the business.

The Register page would hopefully be about the customers that want to be a regular or want updates about the business. This page is still not responsive, but hopefully after I finish this course I could make the whole website as responsive as possible.

The About page is what they would expect from this business.

The Service page would be about all the services offered and what is included in each service.


I'm sorry it took so long but I've been trying to git push it from VS Code but it's always giving me an error, one after the other, so I decided to just do it manually. I hope its okay.
